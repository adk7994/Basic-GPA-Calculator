# Basic-GPA-Calculator
To preface, this is my first repo on github after beginning Python.
I've created a very simple GPA Calculator that uses your grades and credits from 3 classes to create a cumulative gpa. I was using unchangeable variables in the code earlier and just commented them out so dont mind them.
Also I apologize for modifying the code before we needed to in class.
